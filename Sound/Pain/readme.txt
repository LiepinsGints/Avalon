These files are designed to serve as pain sounds for any female model. The naming convention follows the Quake system, where pain_100 is the lightest pain and pain_25 is the hardest before death. 

Files pain_XX_a and pain_XX_b are a deeper, tougher female voice, while pain_XX_c through pain_XX_e are a lighter, more girlish voice.

These are free for use for anyone; all I ask is that you please include a credit to where you got them and email me to let me know you've used them. Thanks!
